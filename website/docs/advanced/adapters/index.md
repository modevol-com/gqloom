# Adapters

There are a number of GraphQL HTTP adapters in the Node.js ecosystem.

Since the product of the GQLoom weave is a standard GraphQL Schema object, it works seamlessly with these adapters.

Here are some popular adapters:

- [Yoga](./yoga): Rewrite of a fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience.
- [Apollo Server](./apollo): A fully-featured GraphQL server with a schema-first approach.
- [Mercurius](./mercurius): Implement GraphQL servers and gateways with Fastify.
- [Hono](./hono): Hono is a small, simple, and extremely fast web framework built based on web standards and capable of running in various JavaScript runtime environments.
