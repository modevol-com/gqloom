GQLoom is a **Code-First** GraphQL Schema Loom used to weave **runtime types** in the **TypeScript/JavaScript** ecosystem into GraphQL Schema, helping you build GraphQL server enjoyably and efficiently.

Runtime validation libraries such as [Zod](https://zod.dev/), [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/), and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) have been widely used in backend application development. Meanwhile, when using ORM libraries like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), we also pre-define database table structures or entity models that contain runtime types.
The responsibility of GQLoom is to weave these runtime types into GraphQL Schema.

When developing backend applications with GQLoom, you only need to write types using the Schema libraries you're familiar with. Modern Schema libraries will infer TypeScript types for you, and GQLoom will weave GraphQL types for you.
In addition, the **resolver factory** of GQLoom can create CRUD interfaces for `Prisma`, `MikroORM`, and `Drizzle`, and supports custom input and adding middleware.

## Hello World

```ts
import { resolver, query, weave } from "@gqloom/core"
import { ValibotWeaver } from "@gqloom/valibot"
import * as v from "valibot"

const helloResolver = resolver({
  hello: query(v.string())
    .input({ name: v.nullish(v.string(), "World") })
    .resolve(({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`),
})

export const schema = weave(ValibotWeaver, helloResolver)
```

## Highlights

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Development Experience**: Fewer boilerplate codes, semantic API design, and extensive ecosystem integration make development enjoyable.
- üîí **Type Safety**: Automatically infer types from the Schema, enjoy intelligent code completion during development, and detect potential problems during compilation.
- üéØ **Interface Factory**: Ordinary CRUD interfaces are too simple yet too cumbersome. Let the resolver factory create them quickly.
- üîã **Fully Prepared**: Middleware, context, subscriptions, and federated graphs are ready.
- üîÆ **No Magic**: Without decorators, metadata, reflection, or code generation, it can run anywhere with just JavaScript/TypeScript.
- üß© **Rich Integration**: Use your most familiar validation libraries and ORMs to build your next GraphQL application.
